            <h4>World number one Scottie Scheffler will miss the PGA Tour's 2025
                 season-opening tournament after sustaining a hand injury while preparing
                <br> Christmas dinner.</h4>
            <p>
                Scheffler, who successfully defended his title at the Hero World
                 Challenge earlier this month, was due to play at The Sentry event in
                 <br> Hawaii from January 2-5.
            </p>
            <p>But the 2024 FedExCup Champion has been ruled out for three to four weeks after cutting his hand on broken glass and needing<br> surgery.</p>
            <p>"On Christmas Day while preparing dinner, Scottie sustained a
                 puncture wound to the palm of his right hand from a broken glass," 
                 <br>the American's manager, Blake Smith, said in a statement.
            </p>
            <P>"Small glass fragments remained in the palm which required surgery.</P>
            <p>"He has been told that he should be back to 100% in three to four
                weeks. Unfortunately, he will have to withdraw from The Sentry."</p>
                <p>Scheffler's next scheduled tournament is The American Express, 
                    which takes place in California from January 16-19.</p>
                    <p>Scheffler said he had "lived almost a full lifetime this one year" after securing FedExCup victory, capping off a "nuts"<br>
                         season - both on and off the golf course. <br>The 28-year-old became the first player to win The Players, The Masters and the FedExCup in the same season.</p>
                         <p>Scheffler closed out a four-stroke victory at the season-ending Tour Championship, where he never relinquished top spot<br>
                             at any point during the four days and became the first player since Tiger Woods in 2007 to register seven or more victories in a year on the PGA Tour.
                            <br>After winning The Masters for a second time in three years, he was arrested and charged ahead of his second round at the PGA Championship in May.
                        <br>The charges were later dropped with Scheffler going on to win the next two Signature Events - the Memorial Tournament and Travelers Championship - 
                        <br>before securing gold for Team USA at the Paris Olympics and winning the PGA Tour's FedExCup for the first time in his career.</p>
