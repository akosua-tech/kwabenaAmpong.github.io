        <p>Ghana, four times African champions have been kicked out of the AFCON after failing to <br> record a single victory in all five matches played: three draws and two losses.</p>

            <p>The Black Stars failure to qualify for the competition is their first since 2004,
                <br> and they will be hoping to grab their first win when they face Niger in Accra.</p>
            
            <p>In the first leg, Ghana held Niger to a 1-1 stalemate in Morocco and will be hoping to wrap up the qualifiers with a win.</p>
            
           <p> Niger, on the other hand, has a good chance to qualify if they beat Ghana after edging out Sudan 4-0 in their last game.</p>

       <p>The Ghana Football Association  (GFA) has today issued an apology to Ghanaians for the failure of the Black Stars to qualify for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Morocco.</p>
        <p>Ghana failed to win all six of their qualifying group matches, thereby missing out on the tournament in Morocco.</p>
        <p>Otto Addo’s men finished bottom in Group F with Angola and Sudan qualifying, while Niger, who defeated Ghana at the Accra Sports Stadium on Monday, finished third.</p> 
        <p>The Black Stars had only three points from six matches -  three draws, and three defeats.</p>
        <p>The poor showing of the team has infuriated many Ghanaians, with some calling for the resignation of both the coach and GFA president, Kurt Edwin-Simeon Okraku.</p>
        <p>The GFA after its Executive Council meeting yesterday, in effect, has apologised to Ghanaians in a written statement today.</p>

    <p class="italic">
        "The Ghana Football Association (GFA) wishes to express its sincerest apologies to<br> the good people of Ghana for the Black Stars' inability to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2025.

<br>We understand the disappointment and frustration this failure has caused, and we share <br>in the pain and sadness of our beloved fans. We acknowledge that the team's performance<br> did not meet the high expectations of the nation, and for that, we are truly sorry".
    </p>
    <center><img src="images/u3k5gy0p.png" alt="image"></center>
    <p class="italic">
        "We would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to our loyal
        <br> football fans for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout the qualifying<br>
         campaign. Your passion and dedication are what drive us to strive for excellence.”
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the Association has outlined some measures to enhance the team’s performance going forward.

        These include the immediate dissolution of the Black Stars management committee, summoning Otto Addo, and a football retreat to engage key stakeholders.</p>

            <center><img src="images/SOC-Cristiano-Ronaldo.webp" alt="image"></center>
        </div>
        <div class="pat">
            <p >Three years after conquering European soccer for the first time, <br>Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo are celebrating another international title.</p>

                <p>Portugal won the inaugural UEFA Nations League tournament on Sunday,
                    <br> beating the Netherlands 1-0 to lift its first trophy since the 2016 European Championship.</p>
                
                <p>"It's a great achievement, indisputable, " Portugal coach Fernando Santos said.<br> "These victories will be part of Portuguese soccer forever.
                <br>Ronaldo, coming off a hat trick in the semifinals, lifted the winners' 
                <br>trophy but wasn't much of a factor in Sunday's final, with the only goal <br>coming from midfielder Gonçalo Guedes early in the second half at the Estádio do Dragão.</p>

                <p>"Things have been going well for Portugal in recent years," Ronaldo said.
                 <br>"The national team has won some important titles."
                <br>The hosts' victory in UEFA's newest competition, created to give national <br>teams more meaningful matches than just friendlies,
                    denied the Netherlands its first trophy since the 1988 European Championship.
                     <br>The revamped Dutch team was seeking some redemption after failing to qualify <br>for the 2018 World Cup and the 2016 European Championship.</p>
                
                <p>After the match, the Portuguese squad went to a public plaza in Porto where several thousand fans celebrated the win.<br> Santos, Ronaldo and other players addressed the fans from a balcony.</p>

                <center><img class="chri" src="images/651942.jpg" alt="image"></center>
                
                "We couldn't have done this without you," Ronaldo told fans.</p>
                
                <p>Ronaldo couldn't do much against Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk in the matchup of likely
                     <br>contenders for the player of the year award, but Guedes couldn't be stopped when he hit <br>a powerful right-footed shot from outside the area in the 60th minute.</p>
                
                <p>Guedes started the build-up to the goal with a pass to Bernardo Silva, receiving the ball back <br>at the top of the area and firing a firm low shot past Dutch goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen, who touched the ball but couldn't parry it away.
                <br>"It was a hard shot," said Cillessen, who was making his 50th appearance with the Netherlands. "I saw it late."</p>

                <p>The Dutch had impressed in the group stage of the Nations League by eliminating the last <br>
                    two World Cup champions — France and Germany. It made it to the final after beating England 3-1 in the semifinal on Thursday.
              <br>  "At the start of this tournament I don't think anyone would have believed us if we'd said we'd reach the final," 
                <br>said Van Dijk, who hadn't faced Ronaldo since the 2018 Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid.</p>
                <p> "We've made a lot of progress. We have to be very proud of ourselves. Now disappointment 
                    <br>is in our heads but we have to keep heads up. It's been a good season."</p>
                
              <p>  Portugal, which eliminated Italy and Poland in the group stage and defeated Switzerland in the semifinals,
                <br> had lost the 2004 European Championship final at home to Greece, but this time it got to 
                <br>celebrate the title in front of its fans after a scrappy match in Porto.</p>

                <center><img class="crow"  src="images/dw0jfjxl.png"></center>
                
                <p>The hosts were in control most of the match but struggled to get past the stout Dutch defense led by Van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt.
                <br>Ronaldo's best chance was a header that went straight to Cillessen's hands about 30 minutes into the first half.     
                <br>The Dutch improved after halftime but couldn't create many significant scoring chances, <br>with Memphis Depay coming closest with a 65th-minute header saved by goalkeeper Rui Patricio.
                <br>The Netherlands kept pressing but Portugal was able to hold on to clinch the first Nations League title.</p>

               <p> "It was a bit better in the second half, and then the goal was (scored) and it became even more difficult
                <br> because they are masters in defending when they are ahead," Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman said. "We were not good enough tonight."
                <br>Santos made changes from the team that defeated Switzerland 3-1 in the semifinals, taking out 19-year-old
                <br> Joao Felix from the starting lineup and adding Guedes to the attack. He also used Danilo in 
                <br>midfield and Jose Fonte to replace the injured Pepe in the middle of the defense.</p>
               <p> Koeman, a player for the Netherlands at the 1988 European Championship, kept the same squad that defeated England in the semifinals.
                <br> Some of the loudest chants at the stadium came from English fans who likely had expected their national team to reach the final. 
                <br>England ended third after defeating Switzerland 6-5 in a penalty shootout earlier Sunday in Guimaraes.<br> 
                Portugal defender Ruben Dias earned the man of the match award. Ronaldo ended top scorer in the Final Four with three goals,
                <br> and teammate Silva was named best player. Netherlands midfielder Frenkie de Jong earned the best young player award for the finals."</p>

            <h2>Juventus reject chance to sign Rashford'</h2>
            <p>
                Juventus have turned down the opportunity to sign Marcus Rashford according to The Mirror.
            
            <br>Rashford revealed this month that he was keen on a 'new challenge' away from Old Trafford and has
            <br> since been omitted from three matchday squads by Ruben Amorim. 
            
            <br>However, reports suggest Juventus will not provide the 27-year-old a lifeline due to his wages being
            <br> significantly steeper than their current top earner, Dusan Vlahovic. 
            
            <br>It is said that Juventus are more interested in bringing Joshua Zirkzee back to the Serie A instead,
            <br> to reunite with former Bologna boss Thiago Motta.

                <h1>Which Man Utd players are out of contract in the summer?</h1>
                <h2>Amad Diallo</h2>
                <p>Manchester United's breakout star of the season is coming to the end of his contract in the summer
                    <br> but the club have the option to extend his deal by a further year.</p>

                    <p>The attacking midfielder, 22, has previously said he wants to spend a long time at United.</p>
                    <h2>Harry Maguire</h2>
                    <p>United hold an option to extend their former captain's contract by another year and the 31-year-old has said "positive"
                         <br>talks have been held over a new deal.

                        <br>Having been stripped of the captaincy by Ten Hag, it would be a remarkable comeback story for the centre-back if an extension is agreed.</p>
    
                        <p>The attacking midfielder, 22, has previously said he wants to spend a long time at United.</p>
                        <h2> Jonny Evans</h2>
                        <p>A short-term deal for the defender to regain fitness over pre-season has become a two-year stay for the veteran defender in his 
                            <br>second spell at Old Trafford.</p>

                           <p> The 36-year-old, brought back to the club by Erik ten Hag, continues to be used as a squad player
                            <br> by new head coach Ruben Amorim but it is yet to be agreed if that will extend beyond this season</p>
                            <h2>Christian Eriksen</h2>

<p>The midfielder, who turns 33 in February, is one of the few players at United whose deal does not include a club-held
    <br> option to extend it by a further year.

The Denmark international said earlier this season that he is not currently holding talks over an extension.</p>

<h2>Victor Lindelof</h2>

<p>United exercised the option in the 30-year-old defender's contract to keep him until this summer so he is free to leave
    <br> if he does not feel his future lies at Old Trafford. Injury has restricted him to nine appearances this season.</p>

<h2>Tom Heaton</h2>

<p>United's third-choice goalkeeper, 38, signed a one-year deal last<br> summer but has not been used by the first team since then.</p>


<h2>Who did Man Utd sign in the summer transfer window?</h2>
<p><bold>Leny Yoro</bold> - Lille, £58.9m
</p>
<p><bold>Joshua Zirkzee</bold> - Bologna, £36.5m
</p>
<p><bold>Matthijs de Ligt</bold> - Bayern Munich, £42.7m</p>

<p><bold>Noussair Mazraoui</bold> - Bayern Munich, £17.1m</p>

<p><bold>Manuel Ugarte</bold> - Paris Saint-Germain, £50.5m
</p>
<p><bold>Sekou Kone</bold> - Guidars FC, undisclosed
</p>
<h2>When does the winter transfer window close?</h2>
<p>The 2025 winter transfer window officially closes on Monday February 3 at 11pm UK time in the Premier League.

<br>The window for most major European leagues - including France (1pm GMT), Germany, Scotland and Spain - also
 <br>closes on Monday February 3, though times vary.</p>

<p>Italian clubs, meanwhile, only have until 7pm on Saturday February 1 to do their business and the transfer
    <br> window in Turkey closes on Tuesday February 11.

<br>Further afield, the window shuts in Saudi Arabia on January 30.</p>
