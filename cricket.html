                 after tearing his left hamstring; Stokes picked up the injury during<br>

                <p>Ben Stokes has been ruled out of all cricket for at least three months due to a torn left hamstring.

                    <br>The injury occurred while bowling on day three of the third Test in England's recent 2-1 series victory over New Zealand
                    </p>
                    <p>The 33-year-old will undergo surgery in January, just months after he was sidelined<br>
                         by an injury on the same hamstring earlier this year.</p>
                         <p>Stokes missed out on four Tests after he was injured during The Hundred and has been 
                            <br>ruled out of England's white-ball tour of India next year, as well as the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.

                            Stokes had bowled 66.3 overs during the New Zealand away series - his most in a single series as captain.</p>
                            <p>England's next Test is not until May 2025 when they face Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge.<br>
                                England will also face India at home in a five-match series during the summer before they attempt to regain the Ashes in Australia over the 2025/26 winter.

       <h1>Ravichandran Ashwin: India legend on retirement and answering calling<br>
         from cricket as curtain falls on international career</h1>
       <center><img src="images/skysports-cricket-india_6779182.jpg" alt="image"></center>
       <P>
        Ravichandran Ashwin proudly says he answered his calling from cricket after bringing the
        <br> curtain down on his storied career with India.

        The 38-year-old off-spinner announced his retirement from international cricket after a <br>
        glittering 14-year career in which took 765 international wickets across all formats and became the seventh-highest Test wicket-taker of all time.
       </P>
       <p>
        Speaking exclusively to the All Stars Sports podcast, Ashwin revealed how his deep-rooted passion for cricket not only<br>
         improved him as a player, but gave meaning to his life.
         <br>"I just gave it my all, despite knowing it's not the popular or accepted method," he said. "My journey is completely mine.
         <br>"I've seen a lot of cricketers over the years with exceptional skill and talent, but the ability to articulate or teach<br>
          another person about it is something that is very unique and comes across to people only if they have explored it themselves.
       </p>
       <p>"The amount of exploration I have had to do to be very successful has left me with a wide variety of knowledge to be able to say,<br>
         with confidence, that this is a game I love and can explore and brutally talk about for the rest of my life.</p>
         <p>ve played Test cricket for so long it's even taught me how to construct and live my life. It's the most beautiful thing that has happened for me."

            <br>Ashwin announced his retirement after India's draw with Australia in the Brisbane Test, a game he was not selected for.
            
            <br>He revealed he had considered retirement in the past but finally made the decision when his creativity could no longer be fulfilled.</p>
            <center><img src="images/skysports-ashwin-pietersen_6784131.jpg"></center>
            <p>"I've never been a person who holds onto things, I've never felt insecure in life," he added.
                <br> "I don't believe what is mine today is going to be mine tomorrow. That has probably been one of my elevating factors all these years.

                <br>"I always wanted to leave things behind as nonchalantly as I can because I do not believe in people celebrating me, I don't believe 
                <br>in the attention we get sometimes in India. It is the game that always stood ahead of me, all the time.
                
               <br> "I did contemplate [retirement] a few times. For me, the day I woke up and felt the creative side of me didn't have a future or direction,
               <br> that would be the day I would give it up. I suddenly felt that creative side didn't have a lot of upsides to explore."
                
                <br>After ending his career as India's second-highest Test wicket taker (537) and hitting six hundreds and 14 half-centuries,
                <br> Ashwin reflected on a watershed moment during England's 2012 tour of India that helped sculpt him into the player he became.
                
                <br>In the second Test in Mumbai, Ashwin recorded figures of 2-145 and was knocked around the Wankhede Stadium by Kevin Pietersen,
                <br> who top-scored with 186, as England claimed a 10-wicket victory to level the series.</p>
                <p>
                    It left an indelible mark on Ashwin, who added: "I have one regret in life. I know KP is a very proud man, I've seen him talk a lot about how he took us down in Mumbai.

<br>"Very early in my career, in the formative years, things on the technical side that went wrong put me on the path of excellence.

<br>"I wanted to take on KP every single time after that. He's a wonderful batter but anyone that didn't have a really sound defence was<br> someone I fancied because I'm very good at picking up players who step out, players who sweep.

<br>"In that particular series against KP and Alastair Cook, one of the finest batters I've bowled to, my alignments were so bad.<br> My left leg was going so far out that I wasn't able to get my length right at all.

<br>"For the rest of my career, ever since 2012, it was all about finding different solutions.<br> I'm very grateful for the series going that way, because if it hadn't happened, I might not have set myself on the path to excel as a bowler because to excel as bowler it's very internal rather than external."

,<br>Heather Knight will captain all three England sides as they bid to regain the Ashes for the first time since 2014.
</p>
<p>England and Australia will contest three One Day Internationals and three T20s (each worth two points)<br> and a four-day Test-match (worth four points) across the multi-format series.</p>
<p>Hampshire all-rounder Kemp and spinner Smith have been included in England's T20 squad alongside Durham <br>wicketkeeper-batter Heath, who has also been named in the Test squad.

            Bowler Mahika Gaur will be with the group continuing her return to bowling following the injury that also made her unavailable for the recent tour.

England fly out to Australia on January 2 and will play a warm-up match against a Governor General's XI on January 9 ahead<br> of the first ODI against Australia at the North Sydney Oval on January 11.

<br>After two more ODIs in Melbourne and Hobart, England and Australia will play three T20s in Sydney, Canberra and Adelaide before <br>the multi-format series concludes with a maiden four-day, day-night Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).

<br>Australia head into the series with the Ashes in their possession after retaining them with an eight-all draw in England in 2023,<br> in which the tourists won the Test match at Trent Bridge.

        <h2>Lewis confident England are 'in good place' ahead of Ashes</h2>
        <center><img src="images/skysports-heather-knight-england-women_6778537.jpg"></center>
        <p> 
            England head coach Jon Lewis said: "We have named balanced squads for this Ashes series, with a good mix of youth and experience. Ashes series' are always special. We want to go there, play our way, and are all excited about the challenges ahead.

"We've come off the back of a really successful tour of South Africa, which gave us some really nice preparation. We're in a really good place. We spent a lot of time reflecting on what happened at the World Cup and we're in a better place now than when we got on the plane to South Africa.

"It's a tough, tough challenge. Is it the hardest challenge? Yes, probably, just about. Winning a 50-over World Cup in India is a big challenge as well, so 2025 is a huge year for us. We've got two very different challenges that we're really looking forward to."
